## Single-step Retrosynthesis Prediction based on the Identification of Potential Disconnection Sites using Molecular Substructure Fingerprints
This is the development branch for this repository. Currently, the following tasks are under development:

1. Multi-processing execution support for:
   - [ ] Dataset processing scripts.
   - [ ] Full pipeline evaluation scripts.
2. Development of a graph-based model for retrosynthesis based on the same approach.
3. Migration of models from **TensorFlow 1.12.** to **PyTorch 1.7.1. / PyTorch Geometric**.

The original version of the code will be stored at master to avoid any confusion for viewers coming directly from the 
ACS Journal Article. After it is finished, the code for the graph-based models will be migrated to a separate repository 
which will be linked [here]().
